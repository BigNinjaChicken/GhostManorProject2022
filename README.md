IMS 390 First Portfolio Peice

# Background:
In this game, you play as a ghost who can take control of the exorcist's bodies and use your enemies to murder your enemies. The story behind the game is that the manor on top of the hill is all over the news, and everybody has heard about the ghost living inside of it (which is the player). So exorcists all around the world are teaming up to take down this ghost and are going into the manor in groups to help this ghost get to the afterlife.
